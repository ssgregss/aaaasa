# Multiprocessing

Running the file with with a `-m` argument activates Multiprocessing Mode, an extension of the original program that maximizes the usage of your computer's cores. This mode generates private keys in bursts compared to the traditional version's one at a time, in an attempt to improve the speed and efficiency of the program. However, activating this mode risks greater chances of the API getting overloaded, possibly causing your IP address to get temporarily blocked. If you are running this program for long periods of time, it is recommended to run the traditional version.

# Proof of Concept

This program is meant to analyze possible ways Bitcoin could be stolen. Because it is impossible to convert a wallet address back into its private key, this program goes the opposite way and generates a completely random private key, then converts it into its respective Bitcoin address. It then queries the calculated address for a balance and <a href="#expected-outputs">prints the result</a> to the user.

This program does this in a brute-force style, repeatedly generating and converting private keys, and querying balances. The ultimate goal is to randomly find a wallet with a balance out of the 2<sup>160</sup> possible wallets in existence. In the event that a wallet with a balance is found, the wallet's private key, public key, wallet address, and balance is stored in a text file `plutus.txt` for later use.

Although this project can be used maliciously, it is simply an exploration into the Bitcoin protocol and advanced encryption and hashing techniques using Python.

#

# How it Works

Private keys are generated randomly to create a 32 byte hexidecimal string using the cryptographically secure `os.urandom()` function.

The private keys are converted into their respective public keys. Then the public keys are converted into their Bitcoin wallet addresses using the `binascii`, `ecdsa`, and `hashlib` Python modules.

The wallet addresses are queried using <a href="https://bitcoinlegacy.blockexplorer.com/api-ref">Block Explorer API</a> to collect balance details.

If the wallet contains a balance, then the private key, public key, wallet address, and balance are saved to a text file `plutus.txt` on the user's hard drive.

# Expected Outputs

If the wallet is empty, then the format `Wallet Address = 0` will be printed. An example is:

>1A5P8ix6XaoCqXmtXxBwwhp5ZkYsqra32C = 0

However, if a balance is found, then the output will include all necessary information about the wallet. A copy of the output will also be saved in a text file titled `plutus.txt` with all balances in Satoshi. An example is:

>address: 1JGM6sREUwt5paFEfHNuzvRy7nXtQdaamn<br>
>private key: 6694e2d40e786839d48b1b699ab9c318514dc0a0f27f2ccaf7f9f32224ead3a8<br>
>WIF private key: 5JbTtbihnAnNbBtqZKmkWbrDUeei1bCamqKPrHJ49vQx1CT8oUQ<br>
>public key: 04475C43E9E58637630E10DB01F2FF38C64430E07E272E4C82C877653B8AF15720E4F98F66B49BB4E91B36D4C08FC4F2E13F0A5079DFCEB1821FA05A9F9F30F361<br>
>balance: 10000000

# Warnings

If you are receiving: 

>HTTP Error Code: (number)<br/>
>Retrying in 5 seconds

Or

>Unable to connect to API after several attempts<br>
>Retrying in 30 seconds

This program queries Block Explorer API for wallet balances making a HTTP request necessary for complete operation. If connection to the API is found to be unresponsive (failing to return a 200 HTTP status) the program will pause for 5 seconds and attempt to continue.

If you are receiving a lot of errors, visit <a href="https://bitcoinlegacy.blockexplorer.com/">Blockexplorer.com</a> to see if their API might be down.

This program also responds to 429 HTTP responses because of the high frequency of server requests. When a 429 is encountered, the program will print the error `HTTP Error Code: 429`, but will not pause. However, if several 429's are received consecutively, the user will get the result `Unable to connect to API after several attempts` and will be forced to wait 30 seconds until the program continues again.

#

# Efficiency

This program is able to handle, generate, and query a private key in 0.5 seconds. However, because this program uses the internet for balance requests, a slower internet connection may impact time efficiency.
